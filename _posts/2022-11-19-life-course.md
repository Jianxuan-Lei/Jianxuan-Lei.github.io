This post contains my notes for Prof. [Phyllis Moen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/phylmoen)'s doctoral seminar *Topics in Life Course: Work and Well-Being in Turbulent Times* at the University of Minnesota, Fall 2022. The seminar, in Phyllis's own words, is to "adopt a gendered life course, stress process, intersectional approach" to "address the health and well-being implications of, and inequities around, the changing nature and culture of paid work, along with ongoing disparities around both paid work and unpaid family care work."

Before turning to anything substantial, I think it is necessary to discuss why I decide to present my notes here instead of leaving them on my notebook. There are two main reasons. First of all, the seminar itself is extermely informative. It covers many topics from various sources—journals in different fields, books and book chapters, mass media, government reports, you name it. Gradully, I realize that there is a need to re-organize and summarize all the notes and thoughts I have written down, in case I need to revist them in the future. 

Second, I am convinced that the life course pespective is *the way* one wishes to think about work and life. This is my personal belief, and you may disagree. Yet it is true that many industrial relations scholars have an issue with the trend to individualize, psychologize, and de-contextualize the study of work (e.g., Barry & Wilkinson, 2022; Budd 2020; Kaufman, 2020). I have even heard an interesting quote that "you can study people's work and pretend that history never happened." This trend is troublesome, as it creates a hegemony to justify problemtical institutions and blame victims. Nonetheless, I have struggled to think about what research might be done to fight against this trend, while appreciating the many insights and mertis from micro, psychological studies of work (e.g., organizational behavior).
