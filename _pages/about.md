**Abount me**

Hi there! I am Jianxuan Lei, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Work and Organizations](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/work-organizations-department) at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I study industrial relations with a particular focus on:

1. Trade unions in different institutional contexts
2. Identities at work and how they relate to power and inequality
      
My research employs an interdisciplinary perspective, informed by economics, sociology, and political theory. Most of the time, I work with quantitative data and use econometric tools to provide empirical evidence.
