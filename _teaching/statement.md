I have taught labor relations at the undergraduate level. My courses explore the intellectual foundations of employment relations, the history of the U.S. labor movement, the fundamentals of U.S. labor law, and key aspects of international comparisons. I emphasize experiential learning by engaging students in interactive activities, including interpreting legal cases, debating legislative proposals, conducting simulated collective bargaining, and participating in mock dispute resolution exercises. More broadly, my teaching interests extend to a range of employment-related topics, such as human resource management, compensation and benefits, and people analytics.
