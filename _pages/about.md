Hi there! I am Jianxuan Lei, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Work and Organizations](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/work-organizations-department) at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I study industrial relations with a particular focus on:

1. Trade unions in different institutional contexts
2. Identities at work (e.g., gender)
      
My research employs an interdisciplinary perspective informed by economics, sociology, and political theory, supported by empirical evidence from econometric analysis.

## My Work and Research
To be added.

## My Background and History
