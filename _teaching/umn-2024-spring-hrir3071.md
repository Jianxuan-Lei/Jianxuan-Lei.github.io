**Course Description**: Labor relations considers the dynamics between employees and employers, especially in the context of employees acting collectively and with a recognition that the legitimate interests of employees and their employers do not always align. This course starts with a framework for understanding *alternative perspectives* on the key issues in labor relations, and then an in-depth consideration of the *legal foundations* of the U.S. approach. This is followed by an extensive examination of the *union organizing* process (how labor unions are formed). Two other major processes of labor relations, i.e., collective bargaining (how union contracts are produced) and dispute resolution (how bargaining disputes and grievances are resolved), are covered in HRIR 3072. The focus of the course is private sector labor relations, but public sector comparisons are highlighted where appropriate. International comparisons and current challenges are also introduced.
