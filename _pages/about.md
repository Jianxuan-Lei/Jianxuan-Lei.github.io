Hi there! I am Jianxuan Lei, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Work and Organizations](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/work-organizations-department) at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I study industrial relations with a particular focus on:

1. Trade unions in different institutional contexts
2. Identities and power relations at work 
      
My research employs an interdisciplinary perspective, informed by economics, sociology, and political theory. Most of the time, I work with quantitative data and use econometric analysis to provide empirical evidence.
