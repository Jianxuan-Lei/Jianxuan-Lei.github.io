This post contains my notes for Prof. [Phyllis Moen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/phylmoen)'s doctoral seminar *Topics in Life Course: Work and Well-Being in Turbulent Times* at the University of Minnesota, Fall 2022. The seminar, in Phyllis's own words, is to "adopt a gendered life course, stress process, intersectional approach" to "address the health and well-being implications of, and inequities around, the changing nature and culture of paid work, along with ongoing disparities around both paid work and unpaid family care work."

Before turning to the notes, I think it is necessary to discuss why I decided to present my notes here instead of leaving them on my notebook.

"You can study people's work and pretend that history never happened."
