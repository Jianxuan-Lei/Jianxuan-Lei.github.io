excerpt: 'In the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, Karl Marx famously asserts the "estrangement of man from man" under commodity production. Given the strong gender antagonism in early trade unionism, this declaration may be engendered and re-phrased as the "estrangement of man from woman".'

**Abstract**: The notion that women do not have the same right to work as men underlies gender antagonism in early trade unionism. While unions have been increasingly promoting female-friendly policies and practices, it remains unclear whether individual members' attitudes towards women's employment have changed over time. In this study, I provide the first large-scale, comparative, and quantitative analysis of this question, covering more than 50,000 individuals across 47 European countries and regions from 1990 to 2020. The results suggest a rather complex picture. Specifically, in the early 1990s, union members did not differ from non-union workers in their attitudes towards womenâ€™s right to work. When it came to the late 1990s, unions members exhibited more egalitarian gender attitudes than non-union workers. However, the union-nonunion attitude gap vanished at least since 2017. Further analysis indicates that a breadwinner ideology, in which manhood is defined in relation to wage labor, is the primary driver for less egalitarian gender attitudes among union members. In addition, the rise of neoliberalism possibly contributes to the vanished union-nonunion attitude gap by emphasizing competition and negative liberty.
