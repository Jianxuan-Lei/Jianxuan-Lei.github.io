Fortunes of Feminism: From State-Managed Capitalism to Neoliberal Crisis (2013) is a collection of essays by Nancy Fraser from 1985 to 2010. The book, in Fraser’s own word, is to clarify the “struggles and wishes” of the second-wave feminism in the United States (p. 26). In doing so, Fraser sheds lights on a new pathway towards gender justice in the contemporary world. As Fraser is a political philosopher, the book proves to be mostly conceptual. The contents of the book are organized into three parts, corresponding to three distinct themes of the second-wave feminism: *redistribution*, *recognition*, and *representation*. The present book review follows a similar structure, as I will highlight the struggles and wishes around each of the three themes. I will also briefly discuss how Fraser’s work can inform future research on work and employment at the end of the review.
