excerpt: 'Labor relations considers the dynamics between employees and employers, especially in the context of employees acting collectively and with a recognition that the legitimate interests of employees and their employers do not always align. This course provides an extensive examination and hands-on experience of two major processes of labor relations: <i>collective bargaining</i> (how union contracts are produced) and <i>dispute resolution<i> (how bargaining disputes and grievances are resolved). Another major process of labor relations, i.e., union organizing (how unions are formed) is covered in HRIR 3071. The focus of the course is private sector labor relations, but public sector comparisons are highlighted where appropriate.

**HRIR 3072: Collective Bargaining and Dispute Resolution**

Undergraduate Course, 2024 Spring (B Term)

Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota

\[[Syllabus](https://jianxuan-lei.github.io/files/syllabus_hrir_3072.pdf) &#124; [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mO336XxcLBylkU4qbN2825FewUQv12I6Brr4T1W-w4/edit?usp=sharing)\]

**Course Description**: Labor relations considers the dynamics between employees and employers, especially in the context of employees acting collectively and with a recognition that the legitimate interests of employees and their employers do not always align. So unlike other areas of human resources that focus on managing employees, labor relations is about processes for managing rights and conflicts in ways that provide employee voice. This course provides an extensive examination and hands-on experience of two major processes of labor relations: *collective bargaining* (how union contracts are produced) and *dispute resolution* (how bargaining disputes and grievances are resolved). Another major process of labor relations, i.e., union organizing (how unions are formed) is covered in HRIR 3071. The focus of the course is private sector labor relations, but public sector comparisons are highlighted where appropriate. International comparisons and current challenges are also introduced.
