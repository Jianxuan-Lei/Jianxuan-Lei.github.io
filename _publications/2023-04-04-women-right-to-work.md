excerpt: 'In the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, Karl Marx famously asserts the "estrangement of *man* from *man*" under commodity production. Given the intertwined relationship between labor and gender, this declaration may be re-phrased as the "estrangement of *man* from *woman*." Men and women are alienated from each other, because work—once an essential feature of human existence—has been construed as an exclusive sphere for men, with women being denied the equal access and right to work. It is this narrowed and masculinized understanding of work that has catalyzed gender antagonism in early trade unionism. While trade unions as an organization have been increasingly promoting gender equality in the workplace, it remains unclear whether individual members have changed their attitudes towards women’s work over time.'

**Abstract**: The notion that women do not have the equal right to work as men underlies gender antagonism in early trade unionism. While unions have been increasingly promoting gender equality in the workplace, it remains unclear whether individual members’ attitudes towards women’s work have changed over time. In this study, I provide the first large-scale, comparative, and quantitative analysis of this question, focusing on more than 25,000 workers across 16 Western European countries from 1990 to 2020. The results suggest a complex picture. Specifically, in the early 1990s, union members did not differ significantly from non-members in their attitudes towards women’s right to work. Since the late 1990s, union members exhibited more egalitarian gender attitudes than non-members. However, by 2020, the union-nonunion gap in gender attitudes appeared to have vanished. Further analysis indicates that a breadwinner ideology, in which manhood is defined in relation to wage labor, is the primary driver for less egalitarian gender attitudes among union members. In addition, the dramatic uprisings of the populist right have possibly contributed to the vanished union-nonunion attitude gap by gendering contemporary European politics.
