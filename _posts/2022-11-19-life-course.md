This post contains my notes for Prof. [Phyllis Moen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/phylmoen)'s doctoral seminar *Topics in Life Course: Work and Well-Being in Turbulent Times* at the University of Minnesota, Fall 2022. The seminar, in Phyllis's own words, is to "adopt a gendered life course, stress process, intersectional approach" to "address the health and well-being implications of, and inequities around, the changing nature and culture of paid work, along with ongoing disparities around both paid work and unpaid family care work."

Before turning to anything substantial, I think it is necessary to discuss why I decide to present my notes here instead of leaving them on my notebook. There are two main reasons. First of all, the seminar itself is extermely informative. It covers many topics from various sources—journals in different fields, books and book chapters, mass media, government reports, you name it. Things become even more complicated given the timing of the seminar—the post-pandemic era that witnesses dramtical changes in people's work and life. Gradully, I realize that there is a need to re-organize and summarize all the notes and thoughts I have written down, in case I need to revist them in the future. 

Second, I am convinced that the life course pespective is *the way* one wishes to think about work and life. This is my personal belief, and you may disagree. Yet it is true that many industrial relations scholars have an issue with the trend to individualize, psychologize, and de-contextualize the study of work (e.g., Barry & Wilkinson, 2022; Budd 2020; Kaufman, 2020). I haven even heard a sarcastic quote that "you can study people's work and pretend that history never happened." This trend is obviously troublesome, as it creates a hegemony to justify problemtical institutions and blame victims. Nonetheless, I have struggled to think about what kind of research might be done to combat this trend, while appreciating many insights and mertis from micro, psychological studies of work (e.g., organizational behavior).

The life course perspective seems to provide an answer to me, because *it connects social strucutres with individual experiences along the timelines of history*. This may sound vague for readers who are not familiar with the life course perspective. Therefore, to elaborate, I decide to re-organize my notes by presenting the key principles, concepts, and methodologies in the life course studies. **Principles**, because the life course perspective is more about epistemology instead of a particular theory. **Concepts**, because they are the building blocks of the life course perspective. **Methodologies**, because they speak to how to conduct life course studies. Since the life course perspective is broad, fluid, and flexible, it is not likely that my notes will cover all the important aspects. Yet I will try to continuously update my udnerstanding here.
