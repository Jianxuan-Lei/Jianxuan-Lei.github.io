collection: publications
permalink: /publication/union-immigration-attitudes
excerpt: '**Abstract**: Drawing from theories of the insider-outsider divide, I revisit the relationship between trade union membership and immigration attitudes. In addition to the influence of union leaders and labor market competition, I contend that preferences for job security and democracy constitute an important source of bias against immigrants among union members. I further theorize that female union members are less susceptible to this bias, as they select into trade unions based on pre-existing liberal values. I test this conceptual model with ten rounds of the European Social Survey data spanning from 2002 to 2020. Analyzing a sample of more than 90,000 workers in 15 advanced industrial societies, OLS regression analysis shows that male union members have more negative perceptions of immigrants’ economic and cultural impacts compared to their non-union counterparts. In contrast, female union members hold more positive attitudes towards immigrants than their non-union counterparts. Importantly, these differences cannot be fully explained by labor market competition. I also document a concerning time trend in union members’ immigration attitudes. Moreover, using establishment size as a source of plausible exogeneity, instrument variable results indicate that unions liberalize male members’ immigration attitudes, whereas no such effect is observed among female members. Collectively, these findings suggest that men and women join unions with different motives. Finally, I demonstrate how anti-immigration politics can hamper trade unions’ agenda for social equality using support for redistribution as an example.'

**Abstract**: Drawing from theories of the insider-outsider divide, I revisit the relationship between trade union membership and immigration attitudes. In addition to the influence of union leaders and labor market competition, I contend that preferences for job security and democracy constitute an important source of bias against immigrants among union members. I further theorize that female union members are less susceptible to this bias, as they select into trade unions based on pre-existing liberal values. I test this conceptual model with ten rounds of the European Social Survey data spanning from 2002 to 2020. Analyzing a sample of more than 90,000 workers in 15 advanced industrial societies, OLS regression analysis shows that male union members have more negative perceptions of immigrants’ economic and cultural impacts compared to their non-union counterparts. In contrast, female union members hold more positive attitudes towards immigrants than their non-union counterparts. Importantly, these differences cannot be fully explained by labor market competition. I also document a concerning time trend in union members’ immigration attitudes.
