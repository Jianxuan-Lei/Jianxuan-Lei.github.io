This post contains my notes for Prof. [Phyllis Moen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/phylmoen)'s doctoral seminar *Topics in Life Course: Work and Well-Being in Turbulent Times* at the University of Minnesota, Fall 2022. The seminar, in Phyllis's own words, is to "adopt a gendered life course, stress process, intersectional approach" to "address the health and well-being implications of, and inequities around, the changing nature and culture of paid work, along with ongoing disparities around both paid work and unpaid family care work."

Before turning to anything substantial, I think it is necessary to discuss why I decide to present my notes here instead of leaving them on my notebook. There are two main reasons. First, the seminar itself is extermely informative. It covers many topics from various sourcesâ€”journals of different fields, books and book chapters, mass media, and governmental reports.

"You can study people's work and pretend that history never happened."
