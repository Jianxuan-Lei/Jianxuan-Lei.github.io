I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Work and Organizations at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. I study industrial relations with particular focuses on (1) trade unions in different institutional contexts and (2) identities at work (e.g., gender). My research employs an interdisciplinary perspective infromed by economics, sociology, and political theory.
