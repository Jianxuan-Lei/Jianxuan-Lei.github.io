This post contains my notes for Prof. [Phyllis Moen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/phylmoen)'s doctoral seminar *Topics in Life Course: Work and Well-Being in Turbulent Times* at the University of Minnesota, Fall 2022. The seminar, in Phyllis's own words, is to "adopt a gendered life course, stress process, intersectional approach" to "address the health and well-being implications of, and inequities around, the changing nature and culture of paid work, along with ongoing disparities around both paid work and unpaid family care work."

Before turning to anything substantial, I think it is necessary to discuss why I decide to present my notes here instead of leaving them on my notebook. There are two main reasons. First of all, the seminar itself is extermely informative. It covers many topics from various sources—journals in different fields, books and book chapters, mass media, government reports, you name it. Things become even more complicated given the timing of the seminar—the post-pandemic era that witnesses dramtical changes in people's work and life. Gradully, I realize that there is a need to re-organize and summarize all the notes and thoughts I have written down, in case I need to revist them in the future. 

Second, I am convinced that the life course pespective is *the way* one wishes to think about work and life. This is my personal belief, and you may disagree. Yet it is true that many industrial relations scholars have an issue with the trend to individualize, psychologize, and de-contextualize the study of work (e.g., Barry & Wilkinson, 2022; Budd 2020; Kaufman, 2020). I have even heard a sarcastic quote that "you can study people's work and pretend that history never happened." This trend is obviously troublesome, as it creates a hegemony to justify problemtical institutions and blame victims. Nonetheless, I have struggled to think about what kind of research might be done to combat this trend, while appreciating many insights and mertis from micro, psychological studies of work (e.g., organizational behavior).

The life course perspective seems to provide an answer to me, because *it connects social strucutres with individual experiences along the timelines of history*. This may sound vague to readers who are not familiar with the perspective. Therefore, to elaborate, I decide to re-organize my notes by presenting the key principles, concepts, and methodologies in the life course studies. **Principles**, because the life course perspective is more about epistemology instead of a particular theory. **Concepts**, because they are the building blocks of the life course perspective. **Methodologies**, because they speak to how to conduct life course studies. Since the life course perspective is broad, fluid, and flexible, it is not likely that my notes will cover all the important aspects. Yet I will try to continuously update my understanding here.

## Principles of the life course perspective
The life course perspetive emphasizes the influence of social institutions, structures, and public policies on individual lives (Kohli, 2007). Rather than focusing on only macro or micro factors, the life course perspective embeds personal experiences in the broad social context. It further highlights the importance of social timing, which refers to the ways that age shapes whether, when, how, and to what end one's experience is shaped by social and historical context (Carr, 2018). 

While sociologists have adopted a variety of conceptual frames for studying the life course, Elder's (1994) articulation is arguably the most influential. Conceptually, Elder's paradigm underlines four key principles: (1) lives are embedded in and shaped by historical context; (2) the meaning and impact of historical context is contingent on the timing of lives; (3) individuals construct their own lives through their choices and actions, yet within the constraints of historical and social circumstances, and (4) lives are "linked" through social relationships. In addition to these four well-recognized principles, recent sociological studies have identified intersectionality—the emphasis on identity differences and similarities—as a fifth principle (Cho et al., 2013; Choo & Ferree, 2010; Fan & Moen, 2022). In what follows, I will briefly explain the meaning of each of the five principles.

### Historical time and place
The life course of individuals is shaped by historical context, both temporally and spatially. The temporal dimension of historical context can be understood as a cohort effect and a period effect. The *cohort effect* represents the influence of differences in birth year, which expose individuals to different historical worlds, with their constraints and options. In other words, social change differentiates the life patterns of successive cohorts, such as older and younger women before World War II (Elder, 1994). By contrast, the *period effect* represents the influence of a social event on changing pre-existing patterns or norms. It affects people of all ages, although it may do so to varying degrees (George, 2014). For example, COVID-19 has changed both old and young people's understanding of how work can be organized, e.g., in-person and remote work.

The spatial dimension of historical context highlights the importance of place in shaping individual lives. Place can be defined as broadly as one’s nation, or as narrowly as one’s neighborhood. Research has shown that both nation-level charactesitics (e.g., economic development and cultural values) and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., social integration, poverty, and crime) can affect individauls' attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and life course outcomes (Sampson et al., 2002). While historical time or place are hardly destiny, they do play essential roles in shaping one’s social locations, interpersonal relations, and life trajectories (Carr, 2018).
